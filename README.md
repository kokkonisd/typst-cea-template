# CEA doc/presentation template


## How to install

The template needs to be installed in a special directory, as described [in the
docs](https://github.com/typst/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#local-packages).

Here's a one-liner for a Linux installation (assuming you have `TYPST_LOCAL_PACKAGES` defined,
which should be set to something like `$HOME/.local/share/typst/packages/local`):
```console
$ bash <(curl -s https://github.com/kokkonisd/typst-cea-template/blob/main/install.sh)
```

abstract="I propose to consider the question, ``Can machines think?''â™£ This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ``machine'' and ``think''. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words ``machine'' and ``think'' are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ``Can machines think?'' is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll.",
